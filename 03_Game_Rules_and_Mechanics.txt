Game Rules and Mechanics

1. Math War (Guerra Matemática)
- Concept: A tactical board game on an 8x8 grid combining movement strategy with arithmetic.
- Pieces:
  - `Sum` (Cross): Moves orthogonally (up, down, left, right).
  - `SumDiag` (X): Moves diagonally.
  - `Captain`: A secretly assigned "Leader" piece (usually in the back row).
- Energy System:
  - Players have `Energy` based on: `Piece Value` + `Dice Roll` (2d5, rolled every 3 turns).
  - Movement Cost: Calculated as `Distance * 2`.
  - Capture Cost: `Base Cost + 2`.
  - Captain Nerf: Captains pay double energy for all actions.
- Win Condition: Capture the opponent's Captain OR capture all opponent pieces.
- AI Levels:
  - Easy: Random.
  - Medium: Prioritizes captures (100%) and high energy moves.
  - Hard: Evaluates board state for safety, positioning, and material value.

2. Crown Chase (Caça Coroa)
- Concept: A fast-paced 5x5 strategy game.
- Pieces:
  - `King`: Immobile target.
  - `Killer`: Moves 1 square in any direction.
  - `Jumper`: Moves 1 square or jumps 2 squares orthogonally (over pieces).
- Mechanics:
  - Jumper Jump: Can jump over allied or enemy pieces. Can only capture Kings.
  - Capture: Landing on an enemy piece removes it from the board.
- Win Condition: Capture the enemy King.
- AI Levels:
  - Uses Minimax algorithm (Depth 2) with an evaluation function scoring Material, Safety, and Positioning.

3. Super Tic-Tac-Toe (SPTTT)
- Concept: A recursive version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Board: A 3x3 "UltimateBoard" where each cell contains a 3x3 "MiniBoard".
- Rules:
  - Winning a MiniBoard marks that cell on the UltimateBoard with your symbol (X or O).
  - The "Next Board" Constraint: Your move's position in the MiniBoard determines which MiniBoard the opponent MUST play in next.
  - Free Move: If sent to a full or won MiniBoard, you can play anywhere.
- Win Condition: Get 3 in a row on the UltimateBoard (or majority wins if board fills).
- AI Levels:
  - Hard Mode: actively avoids sending the opponent to won/full boards (preventing free moves) and blocks winning lines on both board scales.

4. Caça Soma
- Concept: A pattern-finding math game.
- Mechanic: The board is filled with numbers. The player must select a set of numbers (2 or 3) that sum up to a specific "Magic Number".
- Level System (`levelConfigs.ts`):
  - 10 Rounds per Level.
  - Board Sizes: 5x5 (Level 1), 7x7, 10x10.
  - Difficulty: Increases by broadening the random number ranges (e.g., `[3, 15]` to `[10, 30]`).
- Scoring:
  - 1-3 Stars based on Correct Answers (e.g., 9/10 for 3 stars) and Time Taken.

5. Stop Matemático
- Concept: Quick-fire arithmetic challenges.
- Mechanic: Players are presented with boxes containing numbers and must choose one number from each box to satisfy an equation.
- Difficulties (`d1` - `d6`):
  - d1 (Fácil 1): Simple addition/subtraction, small numbers (1-10).
  - d2 (Fácil 2): Larger ranges (5-20), dual-box operations introduced.
  - d3 (Médio 1): Multiplication (x) introduced, skipped ranges (e.g., no 30s).
  - d4 (Médio 2): Larger numbers (100s, 300s), more multiplication.
  - d5 (Difícil 1): Division (÷) introduced, mixed operations.
  - d6 (Difícil 2): Complex equations, large numbers (1000s), tight constraints.

6. Rubik's Class (Dimensions)
- Concept: Interactive educational module for learning Cube sizes.
- Mechanic: Drag-and-drop interface.
- Activity: Users drag images of cubes (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6) into labeled boxes.
- Feedback: Immediate visual correction (Green Check / Red X) and score summary.
- Next Steps: Progresses to `Class2` (Face Area).

7. Damas (Checkers)
- Concept: Classic Checkers implementation.
- Status: Functional basic gameplay (`JogoDamas.tsx`), Rules page (`RegrasDamas.tsx`).
