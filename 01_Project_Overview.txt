Project Name: Jogando com Lógica

Mission:
To teach logical reasoning and math to students (grades 3-7) through interactive web games. The project aims to provide an engaging platform where students can practice mathematical concepts and strategic thinking in a fun, gamified environment.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React 19 (using Vite 6.2)
- Language: TypeScript 5.7
- Styling: CSS Modules, Bootstrap 5.3
- Routing: React Router 7.6
- Icons: Lucide React
- Verification: Playwright (Python scripts)
- Deployment: GitHub Pages

Target Audience:
- Students: Grades 3-7 (Primary focus)
- Teachers: Includes a dedicated "Para Professores" area (manual) for resource management and classroom integration.

Project Structure:
- `src/AA_baseGame`: Contains the core `GameEngine` and shared components.
- `src/MathWar`: Files for "Guerra Matemática" (Strategy/Math).
- `src/CrownChase`: Files for "Caça Coroa" (Strategy/Minimax).
- `src/SPTTT`: Files for "Super Tic-Tac-Toe" (Recursion/Logic).
- `src/Caca_soma`: Files for "Caça Soma" (Pattern Matching/Math).
- `src/Stop`: Files for "Stop Matemático" (Quick Math).
- `src/Damas`: Files for "Damas" (Classic Checkers).
- `src/RubiksClass`: Files for Rubik's Cube educational modules.
- `src/Main`: Shared pages (Home, Contact, Manual, About).

Current State:
MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase.
The project is currently being polished for a pilot deployment with teachers next week. Key game modules are functional, AI is implemented for competitive games (Math War, Crown Chase, SPTTT), and level systems are being finalized for single-player logic games (Caça Soma, Stop).
