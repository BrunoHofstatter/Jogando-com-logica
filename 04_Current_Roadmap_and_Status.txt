Current Roadmap and Status

1. Completed
- Core Engine: The `GameEngine` is stable and successfully powering multiple game types.
- AI Implementation:
  - Math War: Full 4-tier difficulty (Random to Evaluated Heuristic).
  - Crown Chase: Full 4-tier difficulty (including Minimax).
  - SPTTT: Full 4-tier difficulty (including Strategic Block/Win logic).
- Refactoring:
  - Stop Matemático: Successfully reorganized into clean, modular files (`gameLogic`, `gameConfig`).
- Basic Game Mechanics: All base rules for Math War, Crown Chase, SPTTT, and Caça Soma are functional.

2. In Progress (Active Work)
- UI Refinement:
  - Polishing the "Player vs Computer" selection screens.
  - Ensuring the "Nível" (Level) toggle is consistent across all competitive games.
- Difficulty Balancing:
  - Playtesting AI levels to ensure "Easy" is accessible and "Hard" is genuinely challenging without being unfair.
- Caça Soma Levels:
  - Designing and implementing the UI for the Level Selection screen (matching the visual theme).
  - Finalizing logic for Star thresholds (Time vs Accuracy).

3. Upcoming
- Stop Matemático Levels:
  - Implementing the UI for level selection.
  - Integrating the `difficulties` (d1-d6) into a progressive unlock system.
- Teacher Feedback Pilot:
  - Starting next week.
  - Focus on usability, instruction clarity, and student engagement.
- Bug Fixing:
  - Addressing specific issues in the Rubik's Cube classes.
- Design Improvements:
  - Optimizing mobile margins and responsiveness.
  - Improving font readability across all games (specifically `webkit_stroke` requirements for Caça Soma).
