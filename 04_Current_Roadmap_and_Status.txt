Current Roadmap and Status

1. Completed
- Core Engine: `GameEngine` is robust, handling state, events, and validation for multiple games.
- AI Implementation:
  - Math War: Complete (4 Difficulties: Random -> Heuristic).
  - Crown Chase: Complete (4 Difficulties: Random -> Minimax).
  - SPTTT: Complete (4 Difficulties: Random -> Strategic/Blocking).
- Stop Matemático Refactor:
  - Logic successfully separated into `gameLogic.ts` (mechanics) and `gameConfig.ts` (data).
  - 6 Difficulty levels (`d1`-`d6`) fully configured.
- Caça Soma Logic:
  - Level configuration system (`levelConfigs.ts`) implemented.
  - Game types (`GameMode`, `LevelProgress`) defined.

2. In Progress (Active Work)
- Caça Soma UI:
  - `LevelSelectionPage` is implemented (`/cacaSomaNiveis`) but requires visual polishing to match `Regras_CacaSoma`.
  - `LevelGamePage` logic is connecting to the config system.
- AI UI Refinement:
  - Ensuring consistency in the "Player vs Computer" setup screens across Math War, Crown Chase, and SPTTT.
- Rubik's Classes:
  - `Dimensions` (Class 1) is functional with drag-and-drop.
  - `FaceArea` (Class 2) is implemented (`class2.tsx`) but requires testing/bug fixing.

3. Upcoming Tasks
- Stop Matemático Levels UI:
  - Build a Level Selection screen similar to Caça Soma's to expose the `d1`-`d6` difficulties to the user.
- Teacher Deployment (Next Week):
  - Finalize the `/manual` page content (currently a placeholder or basic guide).
  - Verify all "Regras" pages are clear and instructional.
- Visual Polish:
  - Standardize `BackButton` behavior (logic exists in `App.tsx`).
  - Mobile responsiveness adjustments (margins, font sizes).
  - Apply `webkit_stroke` styling to Caça Soma text as requested.
- Bug Fixes:
  - Rubik's `Class2` needs verification.
  - General difficulty balancing for AI Hard modes.
