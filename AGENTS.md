**Jogando com Lógica** is a free educational game platform teaching logic and math to Brazilian public school students (ages 8-13). No login required, instant play. All user-facing text must be in Brazilian Portuguese.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # TypeScript check + Vite build
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run deploy     # Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

## Tech Stack

- **React 18 + TypeScript + Vite**
- **CSS Modules**, mobile-first. Fluid units only (`vw`, `dvh`, `%`, `min()`) for layout, spacing, and fonts. Avoid `px` and `rem` for layout.
- **Font:** Cherry Bomb One (platform standard, loaded globally)
- **Routing:** `react-router-dom`. All routes defined as constants in `src/routes.ts`. `BackButton` in `App.tsx` auto-renders on all non-home routes.
- **Assets:** Always prefix with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` (GitHub Pages requirement)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via `gh-pages -d dist`, hosted on Cloudflare

## Architecture

**Board games** (`CrownChase`, `MathWar`, `Damas`, `SPTTT`) use the shared engine in `AA_baseGame/Logic/gameEngine.ts`. Each implements a `GameRules` interface (`validateMove`, `executeAction`, `getAvailableActions`, `checkWinCondition`) and a `GameConfig`. The shared `Board` component handles rendering, selection, and turn flow. `CrownChase`, `MathWar`, and `SPTTT` also have AI opponent pages (`aiGamePage.tsx`).

**Non-board games** (`Stop`, `Caca_soma`, `RubiksClass`) have fully custom logic. Do not try to plug them into the board engine.

Routes follow the pattern `/{game}Pg` (play) and `/{game}Rg` (rules). `RubiksClass` has a class menu plus individual class routes.

## Key Constraints

- All UI text must be in Brazilian Portuguese
- No login and no external APIs. Games must work offline after first load
- Performance matters. School computers may be slow, so keep bundles lean
- **Windows reserved filenames:** Never create files named `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1-9`, or `LPT1-9` with or without extensions

## Documentation Notes

- Treat project documentation as structured context, not all as equal source-of-truth
- Keep **current reality** clearly separated from **planned ideas** or future roadmap items
- Grade ranges and pedagogical fit are recommendations unless a doc explicitly says they were validated in practice

## Context Files

Deeper project context lives in `.agents/rules/`. Read these when relevant:

| File | When to read |
|------|--------------|
| `game_crown_chase.md` | Working on Caça Coroa |
| `game_math_war.md` | Working on Guerra Matemática |
| `game_spttt.md` | Working on Super Jogo da Velha |
| `game_stop.md` | Working on Stop Matemático |
| `game_caca_soma.md` | Working on Caça Soma |
| `game_rubiks.md` | Working on Cubo Mágico |
| `docs_games_overview.md` | Need the full game catalog at a glance |
| `docs_general.md` | Need overall project context, positioning, current priorities, or future plans |
| `docs_multiplayer_backend.md` | Working on online multiplayer architecture, backend deployment, or adding multiplayer to another game |
| `docs_teacher_manual.md` | Working on the `/manual` page or teacher-facing content |
| `googleanalytics.md` | Adding or modifying GA4 event tracking |

## Optional Skills

Reusable on-demand skills live in `.agents/skills/`. These are separate from `.agents/rules/` and should only be loaded when the user explicitly asks for that skill or clearly requests that workflow.

Current skill:

| File | When to read |
|------|--------------|
| `jogando-design/SKILL.md` | User asks to use the design skill, follow the design system, apply the Jogando design, or use the design guide |
